NOTE: The current CNN configuration is prone to overfitting. Change the structure for a better model.

Run 'python traffic.py \< filepath to data > \< filepath for saved model >' to create & test the CNN.

Run 'python tester.py \< filepath to saved model > \< filepath to data item >' to generate a prediction from the model for a single data item.
